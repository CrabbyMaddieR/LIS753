    <p>The Winterthur Poison Book Project is an ongoing investigation to explore the materiality of Victorian-era publishersâ€™ bindings, with a focus on the identification
     of potentially toxic pigments used as bookcloth colorants. This research came to life in 2019 and rocked the Antiquarian world.</p>
    <p>I currently own 25 poison books, with the recently released research made availible September 2nd 2022. Examples are : Leaflets of Memory, Published by New York Leavitt & Allen 1855.
