            <p style="text-align:center;"></pstyle>The Winterthur Poison Book Project is an ongoing investigation to explore the materiality of Victorian-era publishers' bindings, with a focus on the identification
     of potentially toxic pigments used as bookcloth colorants. This research came to life in 2019 and rocked the Antiquarian world.Nearly 50% of the 19th-century, cloth-case bindings analyzed for this project to date contain lead in the bookcloth. 
     Analysis of a range of bookcloth colors has also identified arsenic, barium, chromium, copper, iron, and mercury.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;">I currently own 25 poison books, with the recently released research made availible September 2nd 2022. Examples are : Leaflets of Memory, Published by New York Leavitt amp&; Allen 1855.
